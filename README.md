ABOUT:
My Project is a mini TIC-TAC-TOE game where you compete aganist your own computer.
I created a box format where the player and computer can interact, now the plan is that the player has to select either 'X' or 'O' to enter into the boxes, and whatever the player decides, the computer will select the opposite letter. Now the tricky part would be to find a way to get the computer selecting different boxes by random, while the player selects a box.
